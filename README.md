# DrawDominosTracker
Track domino tiles and view plausible tiles your opponents have

Status: Work in progress

When playing draw dominos an essential skill to have is the ability to track the tiles in the game.
Knowing which tiles your opponent has and doesn't have helps when choosing the ones you'll play.

With this application you will be able to visually see which pieces your opponents plausibly have by easily adding which pieces have been played and which one you have.

Assumptions of the application:
-Dominos used are a double-six set total of 28 tiles
-Each player gets only 7 tiles
-Players do not pass their turn if there are still tiles in the draw pile or if they have a tile that can be played
-no cheating(trading tiles, hiding tiles, duplicate tiles...etc)
